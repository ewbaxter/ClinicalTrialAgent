## 🎯 Project Purpose

Built to demonstrate modern agentic AI patterns and healthcare domain expertise. This system autonomously plans and executes multi-step workflows without human intervention - a key capability in production AI systems.

## ✨ Key Features

### Agentic AI Capabilities
- **Autonomous Planning**: Agent decides which tools to use and when
- **Multi-Step Execution**: Search → Filter → Rank → Save (no human in loop)
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: Adjusts strategy based on results
- **Tool Orchestration**: Manages multiple APIs and services independently
- **Transparent Decision-Making**: Real-time activity logging and reasoning display

### Technical Features
- Real-time ClinicalTrials.gov API integration
- Streamlit web interface with live agent activity streaming
- Production logging with audit trails
- Search history and session management
- Professional error handling and timeout management
## 📊 Current Status - Version 0.1

**✅ Implemented:**
- Real ClinicalTrials.gov API integration
- Autonomous agent orchestration
- Real-time UI with activity streaming
- Production logging system
- Search history management
- Deterministic temperature setting (0.0) for clinical consistency

**🔜 v0.2 Planned Features:**
- Temperature control UI (Deterministic/Creative dropdown)
- MongoDB persistence for search results
- Email alerts for new trial matches
- Automated monitoring for trial updates
- Enhanced eligibility parsing from trial criteria

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AI/LLM**: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4 (with function calling/tool use)
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **APIs**: ClinicalTrials.gov API v2
- **Database**: MongoDB (planned for persistence)
- **Logging**: Python logging with custom audit trails

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ewbaxter/ClinicalTrialAgent.git
cd ClinicalTrialAgent
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set environment variable**
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Linux/Mac
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Or set in your system environment variables
```

5. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📖 Usage

1. **Enter Patient Information**
   - Patient ID
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Medical conditions (one per line)
   - Location (city, state)

2. **Run Agent Search**
   - Click "Run Agent Search"
   - Watch the agent autonomously plan and execute the search
   - See real-time reasoning and tool calls

3. **Review Results**
   - Matched clinical trials with relevance scores
   - Agent's decision-making process
   - Search history

4. **Check Logs**
   - Detailed logs saved to `logs/` directory
   - Timestamped audit trails for each search

## 🎬 Demo Workflow

The agent autonomously executes this workflow:

1. **Initial Search**: Searches ClinicalTrials.gov with patient condition
2. **Broadening Strategy**: If needed, tries alternative search terms
3. **Eligibility Filtering**: Checks age, gender, condition criteria
4. **Relevance Ranking**: Ranks by proximity, phase, enrollment status
5. **Result Persistence**: Saves search for future monitoring
